                      As is true of most websites, when you use the Site,

                      Pixoque may also collect certain technical and
                      routing information about your computer to facilitate your
                      use of the Site and its services. For example, we may log
                      environmental variables, such as browser type, operating
                      system, CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address

                      facilitate and track your use of the Site and its
                      services. Pixoque also uses such environmental
                      variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site. To

                        to us with information from third-party sources. For
                        example, we may supplement your contact information with
                        address information provided by the U.S. Postal Service

                        third-party databases, such as demographic information
